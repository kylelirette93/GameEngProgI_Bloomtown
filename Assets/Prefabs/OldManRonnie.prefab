  sentences:
  - 
  cantStartDialogue:
  - Hello young lad. Do you like my farm? I grew everything by myself.
  - I know it's not much, but it's all I need. I just wish those damn rabbits would
    stop eating my flowers is all.
  notStartedDialogue:
  - 'Oh it''s you. Heard you were helping that... that wizard. '
  - Well, while he's playing with his potions, my garden's being ravaged! Look at
    it! It's an outrage!
  - You wouldn't happen to have seen any shifty-eyed rabbits around, have ya? If
    so squish them for me!
  inPogressDialogue:
  - Well? Did you scare off those fluffy fiends? Or are they still having a botanical
    buffet in my backyard?
  - Those rabbits aren't going to squish themselves, you know!
  completionDialogue:
  - Hmph. About time. My garden can finally breathe a sigh of relief.
  - Though I did see a rather suspicious-looking individual lurking about earlier...
    but never mind that now.
  - Right, those pesky critters are dealt with. But you know, all this strange business...
    That wizard keeps to himself, doesn't he?
  - 'There''s a woman down by the old mill, Agnes. She''s got a sharp mind and doesn''t
    trust that fancy magic one bit. '
  - Maybe she's onto something? You should go see her perhaps.
  afterDialogue:
  - Now that those pesky critters are dealt with, I can tend to my garden!
  - I'm sure glad you gave those rabbits a 'talking' to!
  - See you around I guess.
